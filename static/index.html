            <h1>Getting There with Deskpass</h1>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges Deskpass had to address when building the platform was navigating members into coworking locations. Coworking spaces tend to come in all shapes and sizes and have various security measures implemented in order to access the building. Some locations require multiple door codes for people to enter, while others need the visitor to navigate to the 14th floor of a building located in the heart of the Chicago Loop.</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>The solution that we arrived to was the implementation of an endpoint in our API known as “getting_there”. What this endpoint does is allow spaces to list a series of steps for the Deskpass member to take upon arriving to the location.</p>
                <p>This information is private and is on a need-to-know basis and we could not disclose the informaton unless the user had a reservation at the location.</p>
                <p>The solution that the team arrived at was an updated space reservation email design.</p>
                <p>The design of this email informs the member of everything that they need to know when accessing the space including the address, hours, contact information, space photo (visual confirmation), link to cancel the reservation, and most importantly, how to access the space.</p>

                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>The implentation of this feaure led to a dramatic reduction in morning customer support issues. We no longer had to devote additional time/money helping users get into locations and led to happier customers and a more seamless experience.</p>
