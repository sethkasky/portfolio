Text: 

I’m Seth Kasky, a designer from the midwest focused on all things web, tech, and interaction. I've been designing for a few years honing my craft in studios, agencies, in-house, and an early stage startup.

I value strong design, empathetic leadership, diverse teams, and sweating the details. Below you’ll find some recent work.
