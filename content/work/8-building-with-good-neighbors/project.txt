Title: Building Good Neighbors

Text: Project In Residence is a 6-month coworking residency offered to a selected early-stage startup at State Farm’s financial community hub, Next Door. My goal as the designer and front-end developer was to communicate Project in Residence’s purpose and rules, showcase past selected residents, and encourage local Chicago applicants.
